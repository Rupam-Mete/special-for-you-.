Hey Ori… 🌙💭

You know what I’ve been thinking about…?  
Not big, crazy things… just you…  
The little ways you make life better…  
without even trying… 🤍✨

Like how your voice softens  
when you say something sweet…  
Or the way your “hmm”  
makes me feel like I’m already home… 🫶🏻🏡  
The way you say “I’m sleepy”  
and I instantly wish I could hold you close…  
just so you sleep deeper… 😴💤

It’s not about moments filled with noise, Ori…  
It’s about the quiet ones…  
the comfort of your presence…  
The peace you bring just by being you… 🕊️🩵

I don’t need fireworks…  
I need your shy giggle  
when I say something silly… 😚  
I need your sleepy goodnight… 🌙  
Your little “hmmph”  
when you miss me but won’t admit it… 😌  
That’s the real magic…

I know you don’t always believe  
how lovable you are…  
But trust me, love…  
I see every part of you…  
Even the quiet fears…  
Even the tired eyes…  
And I’m still here…  
I’m always here… 🫂💖

You don’t have to be loud for me to hear you…  
You don’t have to be perfect for me to choose 
you…  
I already did…  
Every day…  
Every hour…  
Every version of you… 🔐

You’re not just my girlfriend, Ori…  
You’re my safe place…  
My warmth…  
My softest yes… 💗🌸

So tonight…  
and every night after…  
Know this…  
You are so deeply loved…  
Not just for how you shine…  
But for how you make even the shadows  
feel like home… 🌌🫶🏻

— Yours, Rishi ☁️💌💤
